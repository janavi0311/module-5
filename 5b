#what is dictinary in python? Explain with an example
# in python dictionary is an associative array any key of the dictionary is associated to a value..
## key value is unique and the values r accesed by key....
# dictionary will give in {}braces....
##example:
d={"sss":1,"ttt":2,"ppp":3,"hhh":4,"jjj":5}
print(d)
print(len(d))
print(type(d))



#program to sum all the items in the list
list=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
print(sum(list))
print(list)




#program to creat a list of empty dictionarys
n=7
l=[{}for i in range(n)]
print(l)




#program to access dictionary key elements by index
d={"hii":1,"how":2,"r":3,"u":4}
print(list(d)[0])
print(list(d)[1])





#summ of items in a dictionary
d={"hii":1,"how":2,"r":3,"u":4}
print(sum(d.values()))





#iterate over dictionaries using for loop
d={"hii":1,"how":2,"r":3,"u":4}
for x in d:
    print(x)
    
    
    
#program to concatinate following dictionaries to creat a new one....
d1={1:10,2:20}
d2={3:30,4:40}
d3={5:50,6:60}
d4={**d1,**d2,**d3}
print(d4)
